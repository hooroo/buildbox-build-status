# Buildkite Build Status Monitor

A node.js-based web monitor for Buildkite projects.

So that's pretty much the idea. The monitor stretches to the entirety of the screen and fits as many builds as you have. Don't add _too many_ though, or it'll look crammed.

## Installing

The thing works using node.js, so make sure you have that sucker installed. Then, just clone the repo (or download the files), perform the obligatory `npm install` and configure as desired, by duplicating `app/config.sample.json` to `config.json` and filling it out with suitable values.

To run Grunt you will need to install the `grunt-cli`, you can install this by running `npm install -g  grunt-cli`

## Running

The monitor works with a whitelist approach, whereby you configure the `whitelist` value in `config.json` with the projects that you want to track, i.e.,

```json
"whitelist": ["a-project", "another-project", "yet-another-project"]
```
You can start the server by running `npm run start` and accessing it on `http://localhost:5005`.

## Other config values

You can change the colours by editing `public/sass/config.sass` and the number of builds per row on `public/scripts/buildkite.js` (yeah this kind of sucks. I'm working on it).

## Wanna help out?

About bloody time! Just fork the project and submit a pull request with your changes.
